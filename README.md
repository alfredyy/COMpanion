## Evaluating the Suitability and Sustainability of COMpanion:
- We conducted a survey targeted at university students. We also provided them with the project README, the project video, and the APK.
  - Asked whether they have used similar to-do apps.
  - Asked whether they would be more likely to do their tasks with an incentive.
  - Asked whether COMpanion has the basics of a to-do app.
  - Asked whether a virtual pet game could be a form of incentive. 

- We received a total of 15 responses. They are university students from NUS, NTU, SIT, etcâ€¦
  - 6 said that they have used similar to-do apps
  - 13 said that they would be more likely to do their tasks with an incentive
  - 15 said that COMpanion has the basics of a to-do app.
  - 12 said that a virtual pet game could be a form of incentive.

- Other feedback from the survey:
  - One obvious concern was the possibility of users logging in illegitimate tasks and marking them as complete to gain coins. This is one limitation of our app.
